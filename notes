### Build Role Playing games ###

1) JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive
2) Now you can start writing your JavaScript. Begin by creating a script element. This element is used to load JavaScript into your HTML file. You should use an opening <script> and closing </script> tag.
3) One of the most powerful tools is your developer console. Depending on your browser, this might be opened by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. On Mac, you can press Option + âŒ˜ + C and select "Console". You can also click the "Console" button above the preview window to see our built-in console.
The developer console will include errors that are produced by your code, but you can also use it to see values of variables in your code, which is helpful for debugging.
Add a console.log("Hello World"); line between your script tags. Then click the "Console" button to open the console. You should see the text "Hello World".
Note how the line ends with a semi-colon. It is common practice in JavaScript to end your code lines with semi-colons.
4) Before you start writing your project code, you should move it to its own file to keep things organized.
Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line. Then give your now empty script element a src attribute set to ./script.js.
5) Your view has been switched to your new script.js file. Remember that you can use the tabs above to switch between files.
Add your console.log("Hello World"); line to this file, and see it appear in your console.
6) In JavaScript, a variable is used to hold a value. To use a variable, you must first declare it. For example, to declare a variable called camperbot, you would write:
let camperbot;
The let keyword tells JavaScript you are declaring a variable. Declare a variable called xp.
7) Variables can be assigned a value. When you do this while you declare it, this is called initialization. For example:
let age = 32;
Initialize your xp variable to have a value of 0, a number.
8) Initialize another variable called health with a value of 100, and a variable called gold with a value of 50.
9) Create another variable called currentWeapon and set it to 0.
When a variable name has multiple words, the convention in JavaScript is to use what's called camelCase. The first word is lowercase, and the first letter of every following word is uppercase.
let thisIsCamelCase;
10) declare a variable called fighting end with a semicolon;
11) Declare two more variables named monsterHealth and inventory, but do not initialize them.
12) The variables you have assigned have all had values that are numbers. JavaScript has multiple different data types. The next one you will use is the string. Strings are used to store things like words or text. Strings are surrounded with double quotes, single quotes, or backticks. Here is an example of declaring a variable with a string:
let developer = "Naomi";
Assign the inventory variable to have the value of stick.
13) The player's inventory in your game will be able to hold multiple items. You will need to use a data type that can do this. An array can be used to hold multiple values. For example:
let order = ["first", "second", "third"];
This is an array which holds three values. Notice how the values are separated by commas.
Change your inventory variable to be an array with the strings "stick", "dagger", and "sword".
14) For now, you want the player to start with just the "stick". Change the inventory array to have "stick" as its only value.
15) In your role playing game, users will be able to track their stats, buy weapons, and fight monsters. Before you can continue with the interactive JavaScript portion of the game, you need to first create the HTML elements that will display the game information.
Create four div elements within your #game element. Give them the following respective id values, in order: stats, controls, monsterStats, and text.
16) Create three span elements within your #stats element. Give each of them the class stat. Then give the first one the text XP: 0, the second one the text Health: 100, and the third one the text Gold: 50.
17) Wrap the numbers 0, 100, and 50 in span elements, and wrap those new span elements in strong elements. Then give your new span elements id values of xpText, healthText, and goldText, respectively.
Your answer should follow this basic structure:
<span class="stat">TEXT <strong><span id="VALUE">TEXT</span></strong></span>
18) For your #controls element, create three button elements. The first should have the id set to button1, and the text Go to store. The second should have the id set to button2, and the text Go to cave. The third should have the id set to button3, and the text Fight dragon.
19) JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. You can access the HTML using the document object, which represents your entire HTML document.
One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method. The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector. For example, to find the <h1> element in your HTML, you would write:
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
Note that h1 is a string and matches the CSS selector you would use.
Create a button1 variable and use querySelector() to assign it your element with the id of button1. Remember that CSS id selectors are prefixed with a #.
20) We have run into a slight problem. You are trying to query your page for a button element, but your script tag is in the head of your HTML. This means your code runs before the browser has finished reading the HTML, and your document.querySelector() will not see the button - because the browser hasn't processed it yet.

To fix this, move your script element out of the head element, and place it at the end of your body element (just before the closing </body> tag.)
21) button1 is a variable that is not going to be reassigned. If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the const keyword to declare it instead of the let keyword. This will tell JavaScript to throw an error if you accidentally reassign it.
Change your button1 variable to be declared with the const keyword.
22) Use querySelector() to get the other two button elements using their ids: button2 and button3. Store them in variables called button2 and button3. Remember to use const.
23) Similar to your #stats element, your #monsterStats element needs two span elements. Give them the class stat and give the first element the text Monster Name: and the second the text Health: . After the text in each, add a strong element with an empty nested span element. Give the first inner span element an id of monsterName and the second inner span element an id of monsterHealth.
24) Give your #text element the following text:
Welcome to Dragon Repeller. You must defeat the dragon that is preventing people from leaving the town. You are in the town square. Where do you want to go? Use the buttons above.
25) Now we need some quick styling. Start by giving the body a background-color set to #0a0a23.
26) Give the #text element a background-color of #0a0a23, a color of #ffffff, and 10px of padding on all sides.
27) Give your #game a maximum width of 500px and a maximum height of 400px. Set the background-color to #ffffff and the color to #ffffff.
Use margins to center it by setting the top margin to 30px, bottom margin to 0px, and the left and right margin to auto.
Finally, give it 10px of padding on all four sides. 
28) Using a selector list (selector1, selector2) give both your #controls and #stats elements a border of 1px solid #0a0a23, a #0a0a23 text color, and 5px of padding.
29) Give your #monsterStats element the same border and padding as your #stats element. Set its color to #ffffff and give it a #c70d0d background.
30) hide monsterStats with display property;
31) Next, give your .stat elements a padding-right of 10px.
32) Finally, you will need to add some styles for your buttons. Start by setting the cursor property to pointer. Then set the text color to #0a0a23 and the background-color to #feac32.
Then set the background-image property to linear-gradient(#fecc4c, #ffac33). Lastly, set the border to 3px solid #feac32.
33) Just like you did with the buttons, create variables for the following ids and use querySelector() to give them the element as a value:
text, xpText, healthText, goldText, monsterStats, and monsterName.
Remember to declare these with the const keyword, and name the variables to match the ids.
34) Finally, use querySelector() to get the #monsterHealth element. Because you have already declared a monsterHealth variable earlier, you need to use a different variable name for this element.
Declare a new variable with the const keyword and name it monsterHealthText.
35) Functions are special tools that allow you to run sections of code at specific times. You can declare functions using the function keyword. Here is an example of a function called functionName - note the opening and closing curly braces. These indicate the section of code that is within the function.
function functionName() {

}
Create an empty function named goStore.
36) For now, make your goStore function output the message "Going to store." to the console. For example, here is a function that outputs the message "Hello World".
function functionName() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
37) Now create a goCave function that prints "Going to cave." to the console.
38) Now create a fightDragon function that prints "Fighting dragon." to the console.

40) button1 represents your first button element. These elements have a special property called onclick, which you can use to determine what happens when someone clicks that button.
You can access properties in JavaScript a couple of different ways. The first is with dot notation. Here is an example of using dot notation to set the onclick property of a button to a function reference.
button.onclick = myFunction;
In this example, button is the button element, and myFunction is a reference to a function. When the button is clicked, myFunction will be called.
Use dot notation to set the onclick property of your button1 to the function reference of goStore. Note that button1 is already declared, so you don't need to use let or const.
41) follow the same step for button 2 and button 3
42) The innerText property controls the text that appears in an HTML element.
// <p id="info">Demo content</p> 
const info = document.querySelector("#info"); 
info.innerText = "Hello World"; 
The following example would change the text of the p element from Demo content to Hello World.
43) assign buyHealth method to button 1
44) assign buyWeapon and goTown method to button2 and button3
45) change the inner text of display text
48) In your goTown function, change your button elements' innerText properties to be "Go to store", "Go to cave", and "Fight dragon". Update your onclick properties to be goStore, goCave, and fightDragon, respectively.
Finally, update innerText property of your text to be "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says Store.".
49) You need to wrap the text Store in double quotes. Because your string is already wrapped in double quotes, you'll need to escape the quotes around Store. You can escape them with a backslash \. Here is an example:
50) You have repetition in the goTown and goStore functions. When you have repetition in your code, this is a sign that you need another function. Functions can take parameters, which are values that are given to the function each time it is run. Here is a function that takes a parameter called param:
function myFunction(param) {
    console.log(param);
}
Create an empty update function that takes a parameter called location.
51) In your role playing game, you will be able to visit different locations like the store, the cave, and the town square. You will need to create a data structure that will hold the different locations.
Use const to create a variable called locations and assign it an empty array.
52) In your role playing game, you will be able to visit different locations like the store, the cave, and the town square. You will need to create a data structure that will hold the different locations.
Use const to create a variable called locations and assign it an empty array.
53) Before you can begin to build out your locations array, you will first need to learn about objects. Objects are an important data type in JavaScript. The next few steps will be dedicated to learning about them so you will better understand how to apply them in your project.
Objects are non primitive data types that store key-value pairs. Non primitive data types are mutable data types that are not undefined, null, boolean, number, string, or symbol. Mutable means that the data can be changed after it is created.
Here is the basic syntax for an object:
{
  key: value
}
You will learn about keys and values in the next few steps.
For now, create a const variable called cat and assign it an empty object {}.
Below that cat variable, add a console.log(cat) statement to see the object in the console.
54) Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through properties.
Properties consist of a key and a value. The key is the name of the property, and the value is the data stored in the property.
Here is an example of an object with a single property:
const obj = {
  name: "Quincy Larson"
};
Inside your cat object, add a new property. The key should be name and the value should be the string "Whiskers".
Open up the console to see the updates to your object.
